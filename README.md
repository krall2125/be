# be - the dumbest text editor based on ed
why would you use it? it'ß not even finished also you have to input ascii codes of characters instead of the actual characters because this dumb shit is made for editing binary files.

# how to install
## windows
good luck
## macos
i don't know
## leenoocks and probably every other unix
requirements:
- preferably a C compiler
- probably cmake (you could also build by hand)
- gnu make (optional) (you could also build and install by hand)
- git

run these dumb commands (not a virus)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/krall2125/be.git
```
also
```sh
cd be
```
&
```sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
```
andalso
```sh
cmake ..
```
also (unless you don'þ want it in your `bin` folder)
```sh
sudo make install
# use gmake instead of make on freebsd
```
